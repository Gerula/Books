# Books

Problems, implementations and notes from the books I read.

Before, I wanted to create one repository per book but then I realized that some books have too little code or too much code
and with the overhead of organizing it and yadda yadda yadda, you end up with a repository with one or two files in which you
testflown a particular feature or whatever.

So here it is, my books repository which doesn't have any books but some code from the books I read and notes (just to make sure
I don't skim the book but I actually *read* it).

I don't know how I will call the repository with the books I write, if I'd ever need one.
