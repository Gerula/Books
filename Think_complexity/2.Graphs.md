## 2.1 Graph questions

Read the Wikipedia page about graphs at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_( mathematics) and answer the following questions:
1. What is a simple graph? In the rest of this section, we will be assuming that all graphs are
simple graphs. This is a common assumption for many graph algorithmsâ€”so common it is
often unstated.

*Simple graph is a graph in which multiple edges are not allowed (edges form a set, not a multiset)*

2. What is a regular graph? What is a complete graph? Prove that a complete graph is regular.

*Regular graph is a graph in which all nodes have the same degree*.

*Complete graph is a graph in which all nodes are connected to all other nodes*

3. What is a path? What is a cycle?

*I mean come on..*

4. What is a forest? What is a tree? Note: a graph is connected if there is a path from every
node to every other node.

*Forest is a set of trees. A tree is a connected graph whith no cycles*
