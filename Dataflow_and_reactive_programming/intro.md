Reactive programming ~= dataflow

A reactive system is repeatedly prompted by the outside world and it's job is to continuously respond to
external inputs.

There are roughtly 3 types of computer programs:
- Transformational programs: compute results from a set of inputs
- Interactive programs: interact at their own pace to user input or to other programs
- Reactive programs: maintain a continous interaction with the environment responding at a pace dictated by the environment.

Interactive programs work at their own pace and deal with communication.
Reactive programs work in response to external demands and deal with accurate interrupt handling.

Real-time programs are usually reactive but not all reactive programs are real-time.

Any system in which data moves between units and triggers execution is dataflow.
